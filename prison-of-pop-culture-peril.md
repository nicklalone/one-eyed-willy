#One-Eyed Willy's Prison of Pop Culture Peril

"The past few years have not been kind to the Walsh family and their friends. Mikey and Brand were on a high after recovering the jewels from One-Eyed Willy's grotto. However, Mr. Walsh's assertion that the jewels were valuable beyond compare turned out to be very, very wrong. Made of materials unknown to earth, no jeweler would purchase them. Because of that, the Walsh's could only watch helplessly as their house was bulldozed by the Perkins clan to make room for Troy's Herbalife outreach center. The Walsh family moved from scenic Astoria to the rather less nice city of San Dimas, where Mikey and Brand got mixed up in cult activity.

While the jewels were not worth much by earthly standards, they possessed weird cosmic power. The seven people who handled the crystals extensively began to experience changes. Their bodies transformed from manifestations of eldritch energy. They gained strange and forbidden knowledge. Twisted dreams haunted both sleep as well as waking hours. The descent into the surreal was rapid and ceaseless. Most disturbing, The Goonies discovered that the movies and music they consumed became bizarrely manifest in the real world - and it was difficult to tell fact from fantasy. After some ewoks burned Andy's father alive, the group decided something must be done.

Through communication with forces beyond the ken of mortal man, Mikey and Brand discovered that none other than One-Eyed Willy was behind these changes. And to escape his grasp, they would need to confront him in his island lair, find his phylactery, and destroy it.

After sacrificing their younger brother to the Goblin King, Mikey and Brand found Willy's lair. It was far out in the Pacific, concealed by space-time distortions. Assembling their now transformed gang of friends, along with a number of wayward youths from the greater Los Angeles area, they secured passage to the island on a migrating Byakhee flock for one final deathcrawl to defeat Willy or die trying.

From high above, the macabre skeletal grin of large black granite rocks in an open field confirmed they had the right island. They landed in the field, west of a white house, with a boarded front door. Nearby stood a mailbox."

##Concept

I had the idea of combining lots of 80s movie touchstones with Tomb of Horrors. While Tomb of Horrors is iconic, I'm not sure it holds up very well. It's like a master class in pixel bitching. But I used it for inspiration. Then I started tossing in lots of pop culture references from my childhood: Goonies, Aliens, Labyrinth, Karate Kid, Zork, Legend of Zelda, and so on. Admittedly, this is a very corny adventure. Like, stupid. Probably best played while beer is being consumed. But! Anyway, I've had fun running it, so maybe you will too? 

My favorite anecdote involves a player summoning a face hugger familiar. Then they infected a teenager to get an alien familiar.

#Characters

It doesn't matter too much who takes what sort of character. Although, having a spellcaster is usually really fun.

* Andrea "Andy" Carmichael - Level 5 Warrior
* Richard "Data" Wang - Level 5 Thief
* Brandon "Brand" Walsh - Level 5 Dwarf
* Clark "Mouth" Deveraux - Level 5 Cleric (Patron: Gozer the Gozerian)
* TBD: Recommended Spells
* Lawrence "Chunk" Cohen - Level 5 Halfling
* Stephanie "Stef" Steinbrenner - Level 5 Wizard (Patron: Jareth the Goblin King)
* TBD: Recommended Spells
* Michael "Mikey" Walsh - Level 5 Elf

And many zero level teenagers serving as fodder! I tend to give out four for each player, along with their one main character. I recommend using Teens out of Time from **Purple Sorcerer**. https://purplesorcerer.com/create_party.php

##Gozer the Gozerian

Gozer is a patron for Mouth.

##Jareth the Goblin King

Jareth is Stef's patron.

#Wandering Monsters

Roll for wandering monsters and light sources every turn or so. Where "turn" is defined as the time it takes for one lengthier action, like exploring a room.

1. 1d4 Face Huggers
2. 1d6 Cobra Kai Karate Skeletons
3. 1d6 Gremlins
4. Zuul
5. Vinz Clortho
6. The Thing

##Light

For light sources, use the Usage Die from Black Hack. Torches have a usage die of d4. On a one or two it goes out. The lantern has a usage die of d12. On a one or two, it goes to a d10. Then a d8, etc. But huddling around one light source is tricky!

The main reason for light sources to go out is to heighten the tension of grue attacks. Each turn they're in the dark, and very shortly after the last light source dies, they must save vs. reflex or take d12 damage. Grues attack in the dark.

#Monster Stats

#Locations

##Open Field

The byakhees drop the characters off in a field. There is a mailbox here. A bluejay is on the mailbox, eyeing the characters suspiciously. Eventually, the bird flies away toward the forest behind the house. The bluejay is a clue that something is in the trees.

There are some dense woods on the other side of the house.

Inside the mailbox is a **note**, a **frying pan**, a **record player needle**, and **torches** equal to half the number in the party. Nearby the mailbox is a **very large metal ramp**. It would take four characters to carry the ramp.

The note reads as follows.

```
WELCOME TO ONE-EYED WILLY’S PRISON OF POP CULTURE PERIL!

GOZER AND I GROW WEARY OF ONE-EYED WILLY’S BRAGGING.
WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME SMALL AID IN HIS DEFEAT.
HIS DEFENSES ARE FOUND TO BE LAGGING.

LOOK HIGH AND LOW FOR TREASURES OF SUNNY SIDED BLUE
THEY'RE HERE, SHE SAID, ABOUND CLUES

STAY ON THE PURPLE UNTIL IT TURNS ORANGE
BURN YOUR SHRUBS AND RIDE THE LIGHTNING

BE AFRAID OF THE DARK BECAUSE GRUES
AREN'T WORTH FIGHTING

STAY RIGHT ROUND ANY BEND
A BOLD STEP PORTENDS
SPELL THE SPEAKING ENCHANTMENT 
FIND ALL OF THE ENHANCEMENTS

WITH SOME WIT, SOME LUCK, AND MAYBE AN ALLY OR TWO
YOU CAN LIFT ONE-EYED WILLY’S CURSE AND RETURN WITH YOUR CREW

YOURS,

JARETH THE GOBLIN KING

```

##Forest

The forest is fairly nondescript. There is birdsong coming from deeper in the forest. If they follow the bird song or the blue jay, they can find a tree with low hanging branches. Within the tree, on a branch 10' up or so, is a golden egg.

The bluejay will also circle around occasionally and look at them.

There is one lone shrub in the middle of the forest. Footsteps go to and from it if they're looking for them. If they burn the shrub, they can find a set of stairs leading down to Ganondorf's Lair. If you have a zelda sound effect, play it now.

##Ganondorf's Lair

Ganondorf's Lair has criss crossing walkways navigating around lava. On the far wall is a boomerang. If anyone touches the boomerang, Ganondorf is summoned. However, the boomerang may still be used against Ganondorf (although it's less useful in this case).

##Kitchen

There is a **glass bottle** here and a **brown sack**. There is also some **moldy food**.
##Living Room

There is a trophy case here, with a number of slots that look like trophies belong here. There are labels where each trophy goes. Only a few of these are essential to defeating Willy, but a number of them are very useful.

If the characters find one of these items, a ghostly version of it appears in the trophy case, showing them how much progress they must make to find them all.

* "1.21" - The flux capacitor. Can potentially be used to duplicate the characters.
* "Descendents of Jay" - The golden egg. A potent restorative.
* "Link" - Boomerang. A powerful weapon against multiple foes.
* "Spin Me" - The record. Used to open the fireplace in the Dance Hall.
* "Spell Me" - Speak and Spell. Can enchant opponents.
* "He Slimed Me" - Ectoplasm. Can be used to coat blades to stop Willy.

Also nearby on the wall hang a **lantern** and a **nice looking sword**. The sword glows near face huggers.

##Attic

In the attic is a long **length of rope** and a **nasty looking knife**. There is also a workbench that seems like it has seen good use.

##Dance Hall

It looks like a fire place is here, but it's completely bricked up. In front of the fireplace is a multi-colored dance floor and a disco ball.

##Main Hall

The main hall has lots of images of movies and bands from the 1980s adorning the walls. The ceiling is very high, and can't be seen very well at all from ground level.

There is a blue neon line going along the ground here. Up on the ceiling, out of site, is a different line of purple. Following the blue neon line leads to more traps.

At the end of this hall is the Willy poltergeist face. Inside the wide open mouth is static, as if from a television. If a character goes through the static, they find themselves teleported to Slimer's Lair.

To the right and left are doorways with white mist floating in them. The mist doorways have colored gems along them: blue, yellow, and red. Only touching both yellow and red along the purple line successfully opens the portal that leads to the music hall. When this is done, the mist turns orange and may be entered. In any other case, they are transported to the Gremlin Hall.

##Slimer's Lair

The characters find themselves in Slimer's Lair if they go through one-eyed willy's visage.

Going through the visage gives the character +2 AC, as they turn into a ghostly form. If they make their way back to Willy's mouth and go through again, they have +4 AC, but feel very stiff (-2 Attack). This is a warning sign to stop! Third time through they have +6 AC, but are almost missing from the world. They have trouble interacting with physical objects in any way. With great difficulty, they can cause a minor breeze with their flailing arms.

##Gremlin Hall

The characters teleport into the center of gremlin hall completely nude. All of their gear is up in the mailbox upstairs. They are in an area with 10 mogwai, all in a lower pit. Water starts pouring in from above. The water will put out torches of characters standing below it.

Begin counting. They have 10 seconds to get the mogwai out of the way of the water. If they don't, the mogwai start multiplying very rapidly. The sheer volume of mogwai will begin crushing the characters. Randomly kill one character each turn.

The mogwai are also very hungry and will try to eat any food the characters have. This is, of course, a bad idea, since the mogwai will turn into gremlins.

In the bottom of this chamber is a trap door which the water will slowly drain into. It heads to a tunnel which goes to the main hall.

##Left Round Trap

If they head down this tunnel, Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" starts playing and 10 face huggers pour down from the cieling.

The rick rolling requires a DC 20 Will save or they lose -2 AC and 3 points of Wisdom.

##Flux Room

On each of the four walls of this room are a lever and a number. Currently, the levers are all up.

The numbers are:

* North Wall: 12
* East Wall: 24
* South Wall: 21
* West Wall: 6

The correct order for the levers is 6, 12, 21, 24. Or West, North, South, East.

If solved, a floor tile opens with the flux capacitor.

##Warp Hall

At one end of this hall is KIT, the car from Knight Rider. Although, KIT has no engine. But it still says hi to Mikey if he's alive!

Along the way, there is a trap door in the floor. This falls above to the cieling. The slide can be used to generate speed for the car.

On the wall is a lightning bolt button.

##Tron Room

Ahead is a large glass floor, with strange rings within it.

There is a speak and spell here, sitting on the ground. When grasped, it says "You Will Die" and the lights turn out. The neon rings turn brigh blue, and ET comes down on the other ring. He is dressed in Tron gear. Suddenly, a battle ball is thrown off the top wall and comes screaming down.

This is played as a dexterity game. I use two circles roughly 12" in diameter, at opposite ends of a table. It works better with a longer table. Within each circle, draw three concentric rings.

To play the battle ball mini-game, each side rolls a d20 at the circle across from them. Roll once for ET and once for each main character.

Add your ranged "to-hit" to the result if it lands in a ring. Then the opposing side rolls to "catch" the ball by making a reflex save against the difficulty of the attack, but only if they are adjacent! If they succeed, they move into that ring and throw. If they fail, the ring disappears and any characters on it must make a reflex save or fall to their death.

ET adds +10 to-hit and +3 for reflex saves. This is a good time to burn luck!!!

##Abe Froman Hall

Sloth is trapped here, high in a cage. In front of him is Abe Froman, the sausage golem of Chicago. The sausage golem attacks as soon as the characters enter.

Sloth has the single "You Spin Me Right Round" on him, which can be used to open the fireplace.

##One-Eyed Willy's Lair

If the record is played in the dance hall, the fireplace falls away and the Fratellin zombies, along with the One-Eyed Willy lich stream out. They all attack. Killing Willy ends the terror on the island.

#Artifacts

These are items that can be found during the adventure, and potential uses for them. This is DCC, though, so if the players come up with a cool idea, run with it!

##Golden Egg

If they fry it sunny side up and eat it, it gives the person three more dice worth of hit points.

##Link's Boomerang

Allows multi-attack, attack all opponents in area.

##Vinyl Record (Right Round)

This record contains a hidden message. It tells them to use the ectoplasm from slimer to help beat One Eyed Willy. Of course, playing it isn't so easy.

##Speak and Spell

This functions as a charm. You put in what you want the target to do, and they must make a DC 15 Will Save or follow the instruction.

##Ectoplasm

This allows One-Eyed Willy to be hit much easier. It's an offensive weapon against ghosts.

##Face Hugger Sword

This sword lights up when face huggers or aliens are around. Or when one is about to burst forth.

##Flux Capacitor
